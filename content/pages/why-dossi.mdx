Personalized, private GitHub notes on every page. Customizable notes and labels across all repos, issues, PRs, and discussions. Introducing the dossi browser extension - smarter navigation and context-aware insights to enhance the developer GitHub workflow.

Use dossi to navigate GitHub with a sharper focus: create private notes and labels across all repositories, issues, PRs, and discussions. Capture thoughts as they arise when exploring an open-source project, triaging an open issue, or collaborating on pull requests. Keep track of meaningful content and notes across projects and issues using pins and a recent activity dashboard.

## Capture Your Ideas Privately

While collaboration is a vital aspect of GitHub, not all ideas are ready for public viewing. Sometimes, you stumble upon an insight while debugging an issue, and you want to capture it privately before it's ready for public discussions. dossi allows you to pen down your thoughts and ideas privately, making GitHub your personal brainstorming canvas.

## Streamline Issue Triage

The process of triaging issues is time-consuming, requiring meticulous tracking of notes and debug steps over weeks, sometimes months. The chances of losing this critical information amidst the hustle is high. dossi serves as your personal assistant during this complex process, keeping track of your debugging progress and helping you to stay organized.

## Classify with Labels

Labeling offers a powerful way to categorize and track your work. But what if you're not the owner or part of an organization's repo? With Dossi, you have the ability to label data in any project. Classify your notes, define your own system, and make your GitHub navigation more efficient, irrespective of the project's ownership.

## Avoid Tab Overload

We've all been there - a sea of tabs open, each leading to a different project, issue, or PR. Remembering all the projects and discussions you've visited can quickly become a challenge. dossi comes to the rescue with its 'pin' feature. Mark interesting pages, access them later, and enjoy a clean, organized workspace.
