The browser extension will now show when visiting a GitHub URL. You may need to refresh the page if you were already visiting a GitHub URL before installing the extension.

## Getting started

Let's break down the two primary interfaces of the dossi browser extension - the Popup and the Sidebar.

### Popup

The dossi extension popup is your quick-access dashboard, providing an overview of your recent activities and a list of pinned pages.

#### Activity Timeline

Stay updated on your recent interactions. The activity timeline records your interactions with repositories, issues, PRs, and discussions, offering a snapshot of your recent activity.

#### Pin List

Save valuable pages for later with dossi's Pin feature. The pin list in the popup provides you with a quick reference to all your pinned items.

### Sidebar

The dossi sidebar is your panel for managing and organizing your private GitHub notes.

Open the sidebar by clicking on the dossi button. The button will also display the number of notes that you have for the page.

Once opened, you can edit away!

  />
</div>

#### Notes Management

Jot down your thoughts, debug steps, or insights right next to the corresponding GitHub page. You can create new notes, edit existing ones, and delete those no longer needed, all within the context of the page you're viewing.

#### Label Management

After adding a notes, you can create and manage labels to categorize your GitHub data. With dossi, you can add labels to pages, create new labels, making data classification easy and effective.

#### Pinning and Unpinning

Pin the pages you find interesting, important, or want to revisit later, and unpin them when done. Pinned items get a special place in your popup's Pin list and are easy to access anytime.

#### Title Editing

Rename pages to make them more recognizable or add additional context. By editing the title of a page, you can make it easier to recall pages at a glance.
